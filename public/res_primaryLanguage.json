    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Tomislav Pajic. I am a Blockchain Developer who has always been excited about Blockchain technology, but recently I decided to learn Ethereum development and take part in this revolution by building. I learn more about the technology every day, and constantly progress with my programming skills. In the beginning, I coded basic Solidity smart contracts, then explored the Ethereum stack further. I encountered Truffle, Ganache, Infura, Hardhat, Web3.js, Ethers.js, GoEth, OpenZeppelin contracts, etc. There are multiple full stack apps I built that are showcased in the Featured Project section below. Now I feel ready to take the final step, which is to find a company where my skill can truly be challenged, and I can showcase my problem solving while building an exciting project in an ambitious company.",
